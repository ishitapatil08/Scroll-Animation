The "Scroll Animation" project involves creating a web page with animated effects triggered by scrolling actions. Typically implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project aims to enhance user engagement and visual appeal by incorporating dynamic animations as users scroll down or up the web page. Scroll animations can include various effects such as fade-ins, slide-ins, or transformations applied to elements based on their position relative to the viewport. The primary goal is to create a more interactive and captivating user experience, making the web page visually interesting and engaging as users navigate through its content. The project showcases the use of scroll-triggered animations to bring a sense of dynamism and creativity to the overall design.
